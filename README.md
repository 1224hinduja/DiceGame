# DiceGame
A game uses dice and the top scorer wins
In my program there is a chance for two players to play 
Player roles the dice 
  If he gets 1 on the dice then the player looses the chance and opponents get the chance to play.
  Else the score will be added to the players final score untill he press 2 that is stop
If the player scores more than or equal to 100 then the player wins
